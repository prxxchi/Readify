# Library Management System

## Overview
A simple Library Management System built using C++ to showcase DSA concepts and database management techniques.
To create a project that increases your chances of being hired as a fresher software engineer, we'll develop a Library Management System using C++ that implements Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts and Database Management principles. Here's a detailed breakdown of the project:

## Key Features
## DSA Concepts:
Linked Lists for maintaining book records.
Binary Search Trees (BST) for quick searching of books.
Hashing for user management.
Database Management:
File handling for persistent data storage.
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books and user records.
Command-Line Interface (CLI):
User-friendly terminal-based interaction.


## Features
- Add, View, Search, Issue, and Return Books
- Persistent storage using file handling
- Implements Linked Lists, BST, and Hashing

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
2. Build the project:
  ```bash
  g++ -o LibrarySystem main.cpp book.cpp database.cpp utils.cpp


3. Run the application:
  ```bash
  ./LibrarySystem
